            The Pet Hazard Alert System is designed to monitor environmental factors that may pose risks to pets, such as air quality, temperature, and location.
            This system will utilize an air monitoring sensor, temperature sensor, and GPS module to keep pet owners informed about hazardous conditions.
            In the event of dangerous conditions, the system will send alerts to the owner, helping them take timely action to ensure the safety and well-being of their pets.
